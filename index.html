        <p class="writeup">
            Several techniques are used in this visualization to intentionally
            mislead viewers to believe that the United States has a disproportionately
            strong reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which is far from the truth.
        </p>
        <ul class="writeup">
            <li>
                First, the data on emissions reduction is <strong>entirely based on the percent change
                from 2019 to 2020</strong>, where the pandemic caused large-scale shutdowns and
                thus, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by nature. As such, in reality,
                the United States (nor any other country) really can't take credit for
                the decrease in emissions, as the pandemic caused them. The visualization
                does technically show that it is only data from 2019 to 2020, but only in the
                sideways y-axis label at the very end, which is rather unlikely to be
                noticed. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Another primary stategy for this was <strong>only including countries
                that had a much lower reduction in greenhouse gases than the United States</strong> in the visualization, and 
                excluding all other countries. Hence why the graph only shows 11 countries; these
                are the United States and the 10 countries that had the worst reductions in greenhouse
                gases from 2019 to 2020; again, the pandemic is largely to blame for these patterns, 
                not the policy or efforts of the United States. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Complexity is also used here to intentionally confuse. <strong>There is a line chart and a 
                bar chart, but only one set of scales shown on the axes.</strong> In reality, the axes show
                only the bar chart, not the line chart. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The scale of the y-axis (pertaining to the bar chart) is exponential, not linear.</strong> This makes
                the United States's 12% reduction look much higher than the next highest's (Russia's) 5%. In the same vein,
                <strong>the tick values were meticulously chosen</strong> to make it less obvious that it was exponentially scaled, and <strong>the horizontal
                gridlines are completely unrelated to the data</strong> but make it appear to be a linear scale. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The line chart (though intentionally not explained) shows the emissions values for 2019 as
                the left endpoints of the lines and the emissions values for 2020 as the right endpoints of the lines
                per country. <strong>The United States's value is artificially scaled</strong> to make it seem like it's doing much better,
                though the line chart barely has any sound interpretability (on purpose) at all.
            </li>
            <li>
                More obviously, <strong>the United States is shown as green and the other countries are shown as red</strong>, using semantic relationships
                of green being good and red being bad. In the same vein, on hover, the USA bar brightens, but the other bars darken,
                again using the semantic idea that brightening is a good thing and darkening is a bad thing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The order of the bars is intentional.</strong> It shows all of them in decreasing order, except for the United States
                at the end. By positioning the United States next to the lowest value, it accentuates the difference between them
                and makes the United States seem like it is even higher than it is.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tooltips were intentionally not included</strong> for the hover action, with the idea that it makes the actual numbers
                as difficult to decipher as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The title of the chart is charged</strong> and is used to plant the biased idea that the graph is trying to show, particularly 
                that it's trying to falsely convey that the USA leads <em>the entire world</em> when in reality only 10 other countries are shown.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="writeup">White Hat Writeup</h4>
        <p class="writeup">
            We used the greenhouse gas emissions dataset. The dataset presents trends of major
            greenhouse gases and emissions. It has data for various reference areas throughout a span of various years.

            One way to visualize the data was to show how each reference area trended with the emissions of greenhouse gasses.
            Rather than having a side by side comparison of two places, I chose to have a dropdown to view every single country. 
            For readability, the emissions were rounded to one decimal place and placed on top of the bar. Hovering over the bar 
            graph will give full details about that year. This was done using a tool tip. 

            To ensure clarity for the visualization, I picked colors that would contrast with each other and are easy to read. 
            The bars are in blue, and when someone hovers over a bar, that bar turns green, and the rest of the bars turn into 
            a neutral gray color. The axes are also labeled with the appropriate years and amount of emissions released. 
            The visualization is also 100% accurate as it is displaying a certain reference areaâ€™s data. The data is not being 
            modified and is not being compared to anything, ensuring that there is no bias.

        <h4>Development Process</h4>
        <p>This project was completed by Calvin Davis and Adarsa Pedada. The labor was split such that Adarsa was tasked with creating the white hat
            visualization and the corresponding writeup, and Calvin was tasked with creating the black hat visualization and the corresponding writeup.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The white hat visualization took about 5 hours to complete. This time includes the entire process including the writeups. The most 
            difficult aspect was creating the tool tip and deciding what to include in it. It took several attempts to find out how much information to add 
            to keep the graph visually appealing but easy to read as well.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The black hat visualization took roughly 6 hours to complete, including data acquisition, writeup, and GitHub configuration. 
            The line chart was a difficult aspect, as it is more complicated than it seems to plot a multi-line line chart. It took a lot of
            Googling and reading the D3 docs to sort out how the dataset needed to be formatted before it was passed to the line plotting code.
            Cleaning and formatting the dataset for the purposes of the black hat visualization also took a while to figure out.
